See https://github,com/ietf-tools/idnits for releases past 2.17.00 

idnits (2.17.00)

  * Applied patch from rjsparks@nostrum.com to change location of
    downloaded state files from tools.ietf.org to datatracker.ietf.org
    URLs.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  24 Sep 2020 02:17:56 +0200

idnits (2.16.05)

  * Added a page-joining exception, to avoid a paragraph split after
    "in effect on the date of publication of this document." in boilerplate
    text.

  * Added code to handle the "dd Mmm yyy" date format, in addition to the
    legacy "Mmm dd, yyyy" format for document dates.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  24 Sep 2020 02:17:56 +0200

idnits (2.16.04)

  * Tweaked the code to split intended status from author information, to
    match the minimum whitespace currently used by the xml2rfc v3 schema
    text formatter.

  * Changed the error on long lines to a mention if the long line has
    non-ascii characters, to work around UTF-8 encoded input.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  02 Apr 2020 16:36:03 +0200

idnits (2.16.03)

  * Added a special case for boilerplate split across pages which is not
    correctly reassembled to a single paragraph.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  04 Mar 2020 16:47:57 +0100

idnits (2.16.02)

  * Fixed a bug in the discovery of IPv6 example address ranges which
    could result in erroneously commenting about the lack of same.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Jan 2019 16:27:15 +0100

idnits (2.16.01)

  * Changed the identification of [RFC2119][RFC8174] boilerplate to permit
    space or no space between the quotation square brackets.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Nov 2018 03:44:28 +0100

idnits (2.16.00)

  * Modified idnits to be more discerning in identifying possible FQDNs,
    in particular to not identify email localparts as FQDNs.

  * After guidance from the IESG, changed the error for ASCII characters
    in drafts to a warning.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Oct 2018 14:54:28 +0200

idnits (2.15.01)

  * Fixed an issue with the recognition of RFC8174 boilerplate.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  17 Jan 2018 07:05:28 +0100

idnits (2.15.00)

  * Added support for https: URLs in boilerplate, and changed http: URLs
    to https: in messages and otherwise internally.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  04 Sep 2017 22:35:06 +0200

idnits (2.14.02)

  * Added support for the RFC 8174 modification of RFC 2119.  Both
    the RFC 8174 wording and previously accepted wordings are now
    accepted.  At some point in the future, it is expected that
    only the 8179 version will be accepted.

  * Fixed a bug in setting up an array of long and short month-names.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Jun 2017 15:00:26 +0200

idnits (2.14.01)

  * Added a comment about adding IPv6 examples for documents that uses
    addresses from the IPv4 documentation range, without having any
    from the IPV6 documentation range

  * Changed some references to RFC5735 to instead mention RFC6980.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Apr 2016 9:57:59 +0100

idnits (2.14.00)

  * Added a switch --nonascii, to disable reporting of non-ascii characters
    as errors

  * Added stripping of Byte Order Marks (BOMs)

  * Changed a \047 to apostrophe in a help text snippet.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  02 Mar 2016 12:45 +0100

idnits (2.13.02)

  * Updated the expected signature of the rfc-status file.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Nov 2014 17:16:37 +0100

idnits (2.13.01)

  * Added patterns so as to recognize symbolic references to ITU-T G-
    series references, even if they do not match the default symbolic
    reference strings.

  * Added better handling of some draft references broken across lines.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Nov 2014 17:16:37 +0100

idnits (2.13.00)

  * Recognise not only "Updates RFC1234 and RFC 5678" in the abstract,
    but also "Updates [RFC1234] and [RFC 5678]", with square brackets.
    (Note, however, that references should not be used in the absract,
    and a warning will be issued for that).

  * Added an error for the user of references in the abstract.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  31 Oct 2013 13:52:16 +0100

idnits (2.12.18)

  * Added better recognition of expiration dates in some places.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  24 May 2013 18:44:57 +0200

idnits (2.12.17)

  * Decreased the verbosity of state file download messages.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  24 May 2013 18:44:57 +0200

idnits (2.12.16)

  * Changed the test for Code Start markers to only look for the now
    well-established <CODE BEGINS> marker, to avoid false positives
    for the others (a case in point being draft-ietf-mmusic-rfc2326bis,
    which inadvertently triggered one of the others).

  * When running submission-checks only on a document, nothing was said in
    previous idnits versions about too long lines, as it's not an error in this
    case.  However, it's still undesirable, and can cause problems, so a warning
    is appropriate.  Added this.

  * Added a comment about text that looks like a code comment but is not
    enclosed in <CODE BEGINS>...<CODE ENDS>.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Apr 2013 16:54:56 +0200

idnits (2.12.15)

  * Added more logging during download phase, in order to make it easier
    to debug cases where it looks like the callout to idnits from the
    submission tool under Apache has been cut short.

  * Changed the timeout value for state file downloads, in order to
    (hopefully) reduce the risk that callouts to idnits from Apache
    processes will be cut short.

  * Changed verbosity for output about state file downloads, in order
    to make it more likely that Apache processes will understand that
    idnits is working and not stalled.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  05 Feb 2013 16:38:44 +0100

idnits (2.12.14)

  * Modified the handling of pre- and post-10-nov-2008 documents, to
    give more more information and advice on when a pre-RFC5378
    disclaimer is and isn't needed.

  * Added a new nits level, 'flaw', between error and warning.  Added
    a flaw indication for document names which clearly don't show
    the required name components according to the guidelines.

  * Changed the presentation of quoted paragraphs to not contain
    surrouding quote marks, but instead have additional indentation,
    according to style advice received.

  * Fixed a bug related to identification of almost-matching boilerplate
    text in a document.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  22 Nov 2012 16:53:25 +0100

idnits (2.12.13)

  * The use of the IETF Trust Provisions section 6.b License from
    12 Sep 2009 rather than the newer notice from 28 Dec 2009 has
    till now only been flagged as a warning -- turning this into
    an error.

  * Improved the heuretics for handling URLs broken across lines in
    a paragraph.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  10 Jan 2012 16:17:46 +0100

idnits (2.12.12)

  * Recognize references in ABNF comments.  Since v2.08.03 references
    in ABNF parts of a document have been ignored, to avoid spurious
    warnings because of bracketed ABNF explressions; but within ABNF
    comments it is appropriate to register references.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  25 May 2011 16:56:37 +0200

idnits (2.12.11)

  * Added support for explicitly noting downrefs for which excemptions
    has been granted in the past (based on 
    http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/iesg/trac/wiki/DownrefRegistry)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 May 2011 17:27:39 +0200

idnits (2.12.10)

  * Added diagnostic messages for various downloaded status files when
    running in verbose mode.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  05 May 2011 15:15:12 +0200

idnits (2.12.09)

  * Tweaked the regex which detects mentions of 'obsoletes', 'updates',
    and 'replaces' in the Abstract.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  30 Mar 2011 13:56:41 +0100

idnits (2.12.08)

  * Added code to call out to a grammar check utility, from Lars Eggert.

  * Refined the detection of Modifies/Updates text in the abstract, and
    the resulting comment messages. 

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  17 Feb 2011 16:23:52 +0100

idnits (2.12.07)

  * Check that the document is consistent in its handling of Obsoletes:
    and Updates: indications, according to the I-D Checklist Section 3.1.D.

  * Add support for another variation of the 'INTERNET-DRAFT      ...'
    header line.

  * Add some support for recognition of embedded C-code.  This reduces
    the number of false warnings for things that looks like references,
    but are not.  Also add support for code markers according to IETF
    Trust Policy of 2009-12-28.

  * Recognize another version of the 'Status of Memo' section title.

  * Prevent false warnings for 2119 language when BSD license language
    is encountered.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  17 Feb 2011 16:23:52 +0100

idnits (2.12.06)

  * Added a warning for use of 'NOT RECOMMENDED' without including it
    in the list of RFC 2119 key words.

  * Changed references to RFC 3330 to instead refer to RFC 5735 which
    replaces it.  Also added a reference to RFC 5771 for the multicast
    example range.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Feb 2011 16:03:05 +0100

idnits (2.12.05)

  * Changed the error for non-RFC3849 IPv6 addresses to be a warning.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  24 Aug 2010 14:02:23 +0200

idnits (2.12.04)

  * Changed the warning about dates too far in the past or future to
    be comments.  Warnings seem a bit too strong for this.

  * Changed the error about the use of non-example FQDNs to a warning.
    RFC 2606 only suggests the use of example.* or \*.example FQDNs,
    and the IESG checklist http://www.ietf.org/id-info/checklist uses
    'SHOULD', so an error seems inappropriate.

  * Changed the reference for multicast example addresses from
    draft-ietf-mboned-rfc3171bis to RFC5771.

  * Added parsing of iso-format document dates.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 May 2010 10:33:37 +0200

idnits (2.12.03)

  * Moved the check for IPv6 addresses which don't comply with RFC 3849
    from check_line() to check_para().  Changed paragraph assembly to
    recognize split IPv6 addresses.

  * Updated the comment on multicast example IPv4 addresses to reference
    RFC 5771 instead of draft-ietf-mboned-rfc3171bis.

  * More consistence in saying "RFC NNNN" rather then "RFCNNNN".

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Apr 2010 13:35:30 +0200

idnits (2.12.02)

  * Added recognition of additional 'Intended Status: ' strings, such as
    'Standard Track' for 'Standards Track', etc.

  * Fixed a bug which resulted in unrecognized 'Intended Status: ' strings
    not being reported as such (with a warning) and improved the warning
    text.

  * Added a warning if the document date is too different from todays
    date.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  25 Mar 2010 10:12:57 -0700

idnits (2.12.01)

  * The order of final double-quote and sentence stop in the ID-guidelines
    paragraph 5 text differed between the idnits expectations and the
    web page.  Changed to accept both.

  * The ID-guidelines document combines the trust-specified statement of
    conformance with BCP 78 and 79 with the following statement of drafts
    being working documents into one paragraph, while idnits only would
    recognize them as separate paragraphs.  Fixed to accept both.

  * Idnits expected the final URL in the ID-guidelines section 5 para 7
    to end in a slash, while the guidelines specifies it without slash.
    Changed to accept both.

  * Changed the ID-Checklist URL from http://www.ietf.org/ID-Checklist.html
    to http://www.ietf.org/id-info/checklist

  * Added a warning for the format of Obsoletes: and Updates: indications
    in drafts.  The list of obsoleted/updated RFCs should consist only
    of numbers, without any 'RFC' label.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  04 Feb 2010 12:13:24 +0100

idnits (2.12.00)

  * Added recognition of the new 28 Dec 2009 boilerplate, and made it
    an error to use 12 Feb 2009 boilerplate.

  * Many minor tweaks to the error and warning language.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Jan 2010 16:23:45 +0100

idnits (2.11.17)

  * Applied a patch from Lars Eggert to permit a shorter first-page draft
    boilerplate which eliminates the listing of internet-draft shadow
    directories.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Jan 2010 16:46:30 +0100

idnits (2.11.16)

  * Added new IPv4 ranges for use in documentation; patch from Carlos
    Pignataro.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Jan 2010 13:38:18 +0100

idnits (2.11.15)

  * Fixed failure to correctly extract filename and revision from
    references containing 2 or more digits after dash in the name.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  22 Oct 2009 23:00:22 +0200

idnits (2.11.14)

  * Fixed inoperative comment about the occurence of 'BM' at the start
    of a draft file, which can make the submission tool think the draft
    is a .bmp file.  Thanks to Pasi for finding this one.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  21 Sep 2009 14:31:11 +0200

idnits (2.11.13)

  * Added the new trust boilerplate to the recognised boilerplates.

  * Added a warning about the old boilerplate not being accepted after
    december 12, 2009

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  12 Sep 2009 13:29:46 +0200

idnits (2.11.12)

  * Fixed an erroneously included double space in the boilerplate for
    the trust-12-feb-2009 Section 6.c.iii text, which caused erroneous
    diff indications in verbose mode when there was a mismatch for
    this text.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Jul 2009 13:03:17 +0200

idnits (2.11.11)

  * The regexes for the no-modify-clause from the trust boilerplate and
    the RFC 3978 Section 5.2b overlapped unnecessarily which could cause
    incorrect error messages.  Fixed.

  * The text of the trust no-modify-clause was incorrect due to omitted
    space characters, causing omitted warnings.  Fixed.

  * The presence of a no-modification clause was signalled with a note
    rather than a comment.  Fixed.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  29 Apr 2009 0:40:16 +0200

idnits (2.11.10)

  * Added a better diagnostic message when all required boilerplate is
    missing.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  28 Apr 2009 15:05:27 +0200

idnits (2.11.09)

  * Added support for the multicast example address range specified in
    draft-ietf-mboned-rfc3171bis (233.252.0.0/24).

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  23 Apr 2009 15:34:05 +0200

idnits (2.11.08)

  * Turned the warning for old (10 Nov 2008) Trust licence notice into
    an error, as announced earlier.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Apr 2009 10:34:40 +0200

idnits (2.11.07)

  * Added a comment for drafts where the first two octets are 'BM', as
    IE can mistakenly think this is a img/bmp file (despite the right
    mime-type being indicated by the web-server).

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Mar 2009 23:17:24 +0100

idnits (2.11.06)

  * Added a special case to the header/footer-stripping code to handle
    a case of boilerplate being split across pages.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Mar 2009 1:21:54 +0100

idnits (2.11.05)

  * Added the ability to recognize the pre-5378 workaround boilerplate
    (para 6.c.iii) also when concatenated with 6.a and 6.b para 3

  * Fixed a couple of places where boilerplate was tested against section
    6.b para. 2 instead of 6.b para 3, leading to not correctly recognizing
    the 6.b para boilerplate in some situations.

  * Corrected the 6.c.i text to say /or to translate/ instead of 
    /and to translate/.

  * Fixed a bug where a partial match on 12 Feb 2009 Section 6.b
    boilerplate could be mistaken for a full match.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  24 Feb 2009 1:41:31 +0100

idnits (2.11.04)

  * Fixed a bug where multiple new-and-old boilerplate errors might
    be issued for the same text.

  * Copyright notices within MIB modules could trigger a multiple-
    copyright warning, which they should not.  Added code to recognize
    beginning and end of MIB, and suppress recognition of copyright
    lines within the MIB.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Feb 2009 1:24:19 +0100

idnits (2.11.03)

  * Added 12 Feb 2009 versions of the trust boilerplate.	

  * Added two warnings related to the fix for pre-5378 documents; one
    for documents first submitted before 10 Nov 2008 that lack the
    necessary disclaimer, and one for documents first submitted later,
    which still has the disclaimer.

  * Added a warning about Section 6.b boilerplate from the 10 Nov 2008
    Trust document, which differs from the 6.b boilerplate from the
    12 Feb 2009 document.

  * Fixed the naming of a boilerplate entry so as to be able to convert 
    the name properly to section-and-paragraph notation.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Feb 2009 18:44:55 +0100

idnits (2.11.02)

  * Added a comment for drafts where the first two octets are 'PK', as
    IE can mistakenly think this is a zip file (despite the right
    mime-type being indicated by the web-server).

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Feb 2009 9:06:09 +0100

idnits (2.11.01)

  * Changed the initial comment about 'boilerplate required by RFC 3978 and
    3979, updated by RFC 4748' to instead refer to RFC 5378 and the Trust.

  * Added diagnostic comments about which old (RFC 3978 et. al.) boilerplate
    was found, and on what lines, when the trust boilerplate update suggestion
    is emitted.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Jan 2009 13:46:32 +0100

idnits (2.11.00)

  * Changed the warning for the new trust boilerplate to an error.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  17 Dec 2008 11:10:35 +0100

idnits (2.10.03)

  * Additional wrinkles associated with the new boilerplate has made the
    cut-off date of December 16 uncertain.  Removing that info from the
    boilerplate version warning.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Dec 2008 11:40:56 +0100

idnits (2.10.02)

  * The copyright line was apparently also changed somewhere during the
    mad change bonanza which started last Friday evening.  Fixed to
    match the now posted Trust policy.

  * Restricted warnings for missing Trust policy section 6.a boilerplate
    to non-RFC documents

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Nov 2008 10:57:12 +0100

idnits (2.10.01)

  * Added warnings about new boilerplate according to trust provisions
    of 16 Oct 2008 being required from 01:00 16 Dec 2008 UTC.

  * Modified paragraph concatenation to handle broken URLs better

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Nov 2008 7:49:01 +0100

idnits (2.10.00)

  * Added boilerplate checks according to trust provisions letter of
    16 Oct 2008, which will eventually replace the RFC 3978 and 3979
    boilerplate.  No warnings for old boilerplate yet; that will be
    introduced on January 16, 2009.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  04 Nov 2008 13:35:36 +0100

idnits (2.09.01)

  * Added checks for more doubtful RFC 2119 constructs: 'SHOULD not',
    'SHALL not', 'not RECOMMENDED'.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  09 Oct 2008 0:04:48 +0200

idnits (2.09.00)

  * Lately, multiple drafts with bad filenames have appeared -- so the
    filename checks were clearly insufficient.  In one case, the draft
    contained one (OK) draft name internally, and another as file name.
    This was not caught by the submission checks...  Accordingly, this
    version adds two additional filename checks.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  17 Sep 2008 19:16:34 +0200

idnits (2.08.11)

  * The attach-idnits script failed to enclose the idnits results when
    non-fatal errors (such as failed download of a possible draft status
    file) occurred.  Changed to always enclose the results, even when
    failures occur.

  * The error count when no IPR, Copyright or other boilerplate was
    found was correct but non-intuitive.  Changed to count this only
    as 1 error.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  09 May 2008 17:14:19 +0200

idnits (2.08.10)

  * Fixed a bug where RFC 2119 words at the end of a line would not be
    registered as 2119 words.  Thanks to Arnt Gulbrandsen for finding this.

  * Added a new switch, to silence comments about missing document
    state files: --quiet-download

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  09 May 2008 17:14:19 +0200

idnits (2.08.09)

  * Added separate warnings about not using documentation IP addresses
    for IPv4 multicast addresses, IPv6 link-local addresses and IPv6
    unique-local addresses.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  08 May 2008 2:42:19 +0200

idnits (2.08.08)

  * Corrected a flaw in the regexp for imap_rule_format

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  16 Apr 2008 10:40:00 +0200

idnits (2.08.07)

  * Disabling support for mawk -- it's been broken for some time, and
    investigation shows that paragraph matching doesn't work as expected,
    without pinpointing what triggers the bug and giving a workaround.

  * Adding support for recognizing some IMAP server responses which
    otherwise would have been taken for references.  Thanks to Arnt
    Gulbrandsen for this.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  16 Apr 2008 00:04:27 +0200

idnits (2.08.06)

  * Removed -N argument from wget invocation.  Doesn't make sense
    together with "-O -".

  * Record the date of successful download of a state file in the .date file

  * Added information about outdated state files to selected errors and
    warnings.

  * Fixed a minor bug where all download comments information didn't go to
    the same output file handle.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Apr 2008 9:21:33 +0200

idnits (2.08.05)

  * State files weren't closed when done reading them.  Fixed.

  * Added warnings for reference to RFCs which haven't been issued.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  30 Mar 2008 1:51:40 +0100

idnits (2.08.04)

  * Fixed a case where a valid ToC had parenthesized after the ToC
    intro line:

       Table of Contents (will be updated after WG discussion)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Feb 2008 13:23:25 +0100

idnits (2.08.03)

  * Improved differentiation between ABNF and references

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Feb 2008 12:32:03 +0100

idnits (2.08.02)

  New rev based on input from John Klensin:

  * The note about information on normative references referred to
    RFC 3967 -- added a reference to 4897, which updates it.

  * Improved the extraction of referenced RFC number in references

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Feb 2008 11:28:03 +0100

idnits (2.08.01)

  * Added text to the 3978 Section 5.2(b) and 5.3 comments for individual
    drafts that submission to the IESG for publication with that text
    would be an error.

  * Removed the suggestion to run with --verbose option from the output
    when running with --submitcheck.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Feb 2008 0:57:07 +0100

idnits (2.08.00)

  * When running withh --submitcheck, be verbose about boilerplate
    problems.

  * When running withh --submitcheck, report missing ToC as a warning
    rather than an error (for documents longer than 15 pages)

  * If the document is an individual draft, rather than an ietf draft,
    the Publication Limitation and Derivative works clauses are reported
    as comments, rather than warnings.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Feb 2008 0:06:09 +0100

idnits (2.07.00)

  * Someone just submitted a draft named draft--...--00.txt (leading and
    trailing double-hyphens) which is both against custom, against ID-
    guidelines intent (empty components) and breaks a bunch of tool
    assumptions.  Adding checks for this.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  08 Feb 2008 19:10:37 +0100

idnits (2.06.01)

  * Under OS X (e.g., Darwin) there seems to be trouble with some sed
    expressions, in particular  /match/N; s/\n//  does not seem to work.
    Rewrote the operation in question using awk instead, which makes
    draft reference state download work for draft names split across a
    line break.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  23 Jan 2008 17:14:37 +0100

idnits (2.06.00)

    * Changed matching algorithm to catch leading matching components of
      run-together boilerplate components, to give better error messages.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  22 Jan 2008 22:48:23 +0100

idnits (2.05.04)

    * Now accepting Intended Status: indication not only in the lefthand part
      of the header.

    * Fixed a bug in the header-stripping code which could strip out
      non-header lines starting with "RFC" by making the regex much more
      selective.

    * Added acceptance of the title of RFC 2119 in the key words boilerplate.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  22 Jan 2008 21:41:41 +0100

idnits (2.05.03)

    * Added line-ending normalization for both DOS and MAC type line endings.
      Documents with MAC line ending (^M) were not handled correctly earlier.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  29 Nov 2007 0:24:43 +0100

idnits (2.05.02)

    * Fixed a bug with RFC status file download when running as a web- service
      (from the tools/idnits/ directory).

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  29 Nov 2007 0:24:43 +0100

idnits (2.05.01)

    * Added a tweak to make idnits work under Windows/cygwin.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Nov 2007 21:40:37 +0100

idnits (2.05.00)

    * Fixed a problem where the return code when given a non-existent
      file name would be zero, rather than non-zero.

    * Added assembly of text paragraphs in general, using the paragraph
      from get_para() if present, otherwise assembling new paragraphs
      during normal line-by-line operation.  This permits reliable
      checks of word combinations and words that may be broken across
      lines.

    * Added checks for bad word combinations 'MUST not' and 'MAY NOT'.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Nov 2007 19:04:33 +0200

idnits (2.04.16)

    * Added detection of multiple references to the same draft or RFC.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Sep 2007 20:09:38 +0200

idnits (2.04.15)

    * Fixed a bug in the extraction of draft names for state downloading.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Sep 2007 18:04:58 +0200

idnits (2.04.14)

    * Look for the occurrence of "ABNF" before applying ABNF exception
      to reference pattern recognition
    * Added a warning for possible missing NROFF postprocessing

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  22 Aug 2007 16:43:10 +0200

idnits (2.04.13)

    * Change RFC reference for documentation IPv6 numbers from 3848 to
      the correct RFC 3849
    * Incorporate fixes from Dan Wing for cygwin related issues having
      to do with handling of \r\n line endings in downloaded status files
      and extracted reference information

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  17 Aug 2007 17:57:53 +0200

idnits (2.04.12)

    * Accept 2001:0db8: as well as 2001:db8: for RFC 3848 addresses

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  09 Jul 2007 18:13:08 +0200

idnits (2.04.11)

    * Changed the message for 'outdated reference' where it is a draft
      with a *higher* version number

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  09 Jul 2007 16:38:18 +0200

idnits (2.04.10)

    * Added comments about use of 'MAY NOT' and other undefined
      requirements expressions.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Jul 2007 12:42:42 +0200

idnits (2.04.09)

  * Fixed off-by-one error when testing if expiration date was present
    on the first page ( the first 58 lines ).
  * Added another variation on expiration date text.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Jun 2007 1:12:57 +0200

idnits (2.04.08)

  * Added a reference to RFC 3967 about using normative references to
    lower-maturity documents, when applicable.
  * Added '?' as a character permitted to occur after a reference

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  04 Jun 2007 17:33:26 +0200

idnits (2.04.07)

  * Added "^editors?:$" as acceptable authors address section name.
  * Downgraded IPv4 example address check to warning
  * Added code to recognize references of the form RFC-1234 (with
    an embedded dash) as references to RFCs
  * Tweaked the warning text for unused references
  * Tweaked the texta about using the --verbose option

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Apr 2007 20:07:44 +0200

idnits (2.04.06)

  * Added "^authors?:$" as acceptable authors address section name.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  11 Apr 2007 15:52:06 +0200

idnits (2.04.05)

  * For obsolete referenced RFCs, added an indication of the RFCs
    which obsoleted them.
  * Changed the state indication of RFCs with unknown state from
    Unknown to Unknown state.
  * Moved the legend for error, warning, info marks to the summary
    instead of having it at the beginning of the report

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  04 Apr 2007 13:44:31 +0200

idnits (2.04.04)

  * Major changes in how the output looks:

  * Changed Error and Warning indications to be more obvious about the
    type of indication.  
  * Added a third indication type, "Comment".
  * Added a blank line between indications.
  * Some wording tweaks
  * Added handling for embedded newlines in fold() function.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Apr 2007 17:16:39 +0200

idnits (2.04.03)

  * Added the RFC4193 Unique Local Address rang FC00::/7 to the RFC 3849
    specified IPv6 addresses which are accepted in documents.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Mar 2007 17:07:29 +0100

idnits (2.04.02)

  * Added a --submitcheck switch which only issues errors and
    warnings related to boilerplate and 1id-guidelines requirements.
  * Added some ABNF rule detection heuristics to reduce false
    reference identification in ABNF rules

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Mar 2007 1:12:42 +0100

idnits (2.04.01)

  * Changed the indication of no issues found after the individual
    checking sections from \"Nothing found here\" to \"No issues found here\".

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Mar 2007 0:23:54 +0100

idnits (2.04.00)

  * Tweaked the header and footer stripping.  Some drafts which
    correctly had the indication "Internet-Draft" at the top of the
    first page got this line stripped out, resulting in an inappropriate
    warning.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Mar 2007 0:21:00 +0100

idnits (2.03.17)

  * Some minor refactoring.
  * Changed download() to not touch the date of old files; instead
    use a different file to hold the last-download-attempt-date state.
  * Tweaked the regex for reference sections.
  * Removed the downref warnings on things that look like references
    but probably are not.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  13 Mar 2007 16:36:21 +0100

idnits (2.03.16)

  * Minor refactoring of the regex for references
  * Fixed bug in generating draft name from xml2rfc format draft
    reference tag -- "[I-D.ietf-mip4-subject]".

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Mar 2007 18:16:37 +0100

idnits (2.03.15)

  * Tweaked the regex for references to include IEEE reference tags
    containing dots (period characters).

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Mar 2007 15:41:22 +0100

idnits (2.03.14)

  * Only cosmetic changes to the reference related warnings.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Mar 2007 11:54:39 +0100

idnits (2.03.13)

  * Added checks for outdated references -- drafts which have been
    published as RFC, or for which later revisions exist

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  06 Mar 2007 11:31:47 +0100

idnits (2.03.12)

  * Fixed a bug where --verbose mode would not handle files with DOS
    line endings properly.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Mar 2007 19:25:58 +0100

idnits (2.03.11)

  * Added downref checking also for references occurring in the document
    text, but not listed in the reference section.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  02 Mar 2007 17:43:27 +0100

idnits (2.03.10)

  * Added a note about empty iana sections.
  * Refined the extraction of draft names from the document (for draft
    statefile retrieval)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  02 Mar 2007 0:09:57 +0100

idnits (2.03.9)

  * Tweaked the regex to extract RFC number from a reference text to
    include more valid variations.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  27 Feb 2007 16:18:40 +0100

idnits (2.03.8)

  * Added checking of intended status for referenced drafts.  (This
    requires downloading of state information for the draft, which
    implies being online.)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  27 Feb 2007 01:19:40 +0100

idnits (2.03.7)

  * References containing a period character were not seen as references.
    This is necessary to avoid a certain class of false positives, but
    collides with the xml2rfc format for references to drafts, which
    have the form "I-D.name-subject".  Similar formats are generated by
    xml2rfc for references to IEEE documents. Fixed by also accepting reference
    names beginning with "I-D.", "ID.", and "IEEE.".

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  26 Feb 2007 13:33:50 +0100

idnits (2.03.6)

  * Fixed a message text nit.
  * Added a check for RFC 2119 text but no 2119 keyword usage.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  22 Feb 2007 13:49:23 +0100

idnits (2.03.5)

  * Added support for ispell as an alternative to aspell

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Feb 2007 14:14:27 +0100

idnits (2.03.4)

  * Fixed parsing of the "--spellcheck" switch which was broken; it ate the
    following word on the command line.
  * On FreeBSD / Darwin, the handling of \\t is different in either bash
    or sed -- changed to using literal tabs instead of "\\t" in two places.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Feb 2007 13:52:38 +0100

idnits (2.03.3)

  * When looking for the draft file-name on the first page, idnits
    could pick up a draft name in an 'Updates:' or 'Obsoletes:'
    clause, which would refer to another draft.  Fixed.
  * Fixed a typo in the private IPv4 address warning.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Feb 2007 9:28:54 +0100

idnits (2.03.2)

  * Failure to find expiration date in footer of first page fixed.
  * Added 72.16.0.0/12 private address range to the private addresses
    identified and reported.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Feb 2007 18:21:02 +0100

idnits (2.03.1)

  * The code to look for one of a number of alternative executables
    did not work under Cygwin.  Tweaked to work better, but is still 
    not widely tested.
  * Added spell checking if aspell is available and spelling switch given.
  * Fixed a bug where sometimes an incorrect indication could be made
    about the document having multiple sections matching a boilerplate
    section start.
  * Removed private address range 10.x.x.x from the RFC 3330 warnings;
    missed them in 2.02.2.
  * Added a separate warning for private range IPv4 addresses (10.x.x.x,
    192.168.x.x)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  18 Feb 2007 13:05:33 +0100

idnits (2.03.0)

  * RFC 3978 Section 5.2 derivative code limitations were not recognized
    when run together with the RFC 3978 Section 5.1 paragraph.  Fixed.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  16 Feb 2007 14:45:16 +0100

idnits (2.02.2)

  * Tweaked the removal of possible extension from document name as given
    in the text, and from the actual file name.
  * Added a switch "--showtext" which appends the (stripped) draft text
    to the nits report, with line numbers.
  * Refined the regexp and test for IPv4 literals to require 4 dot
    components exactly, and have none of the components larger than 255.
  * Removed private address range 192.168.x.x from the RFC 3330 warnings;
    they make sense when discussing NATs and private networks, and are
    recognized as martians by firewalls, so are not harmful in the same
    way as assignable addresses are.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  15 Feb 2007 16:45:52 +0100

idnits (2.02.1)

  * Several tweaks to make recognition of reference use vs. reference
    definition better.  Reference usage is now recognized also in
    appendices and non-appendix sections after the reference section,
    and in the reference definitions themselves.    

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Feb 2007 0:08:22 +0100

idnits (2.02.0)

  * Permitted up to 6 spaces between section number and section title.
    This makes a class of documents which are OK, but didn't earlier
    pass idnits checking now pass fine.  Some regex changes has
    removed the false positives formerly caused by permitting this
    amount of space between number and title.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  13 Feb 2007 16:05:15 +0100

idnits (2.01.2)

  * Added an alternative regex for expiration date.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Feb 2007 6:59:00 +0100

idnits (2.01.1)

  * Various minor tweaks to the report format.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Feb 2007 6:08:27 +0100

idnits (2.01.0)

  * Changed the error coding of several errors:
    - Authors Address section: ID-Checklist
    - too long lines: ID-Checklist
    - No control characters: ID-Checklist
    - Bad FQDNs: ID-Cheklist
    - Bad IPv4 and IPv6 literal addresses: ID-Checklist
    - Ragged-Right: ID-Checklist

  * Improved handling of reference definitions which have been run
    together without separating blanklines.

  * Tweaked the error message for informative reference to obsoleted RFCs.

  * Normative references to obsoleted RFCs now produce an error.

  * The RFC status file is now generated with exception indications for
    informational RFCs which may be normatively referenced by standards

  * Changed the output format to have an extra initial section regarding
    boilerplate which is required by both the ID-Checklist and the
    ID-Guidelines.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Feb 2007 5:39:20 +0100

idnits (2.00.3)

  * When running as a web service, $HOME may not be set.  Using /var/tmp
    instead in that case.
  * Cleaned up the 3978 vs. 4748 error messages to be consistent and
    not give multiple messages for one problem.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Feb 2007 20:09:36 +0100

idnits (2.00.2)

  * Moved the location of the rfc state file from $progdir/ to
    $HOME/.idnits/, which is more likely to be writable when
    idnits has been installed as a package.
  * Made idnits always issue a nit and warning count if any
    errors or warnings were found.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  03 Feb 2007 13:13:55 +0100

idnits (2.00.1)

  * The --year switch was not handled properly.  Fixed.
  * In verbose mode, errors reported in detail line-by-line were not
    also reported in the summary, purposely.  This seems to have been
    unexpected by the users, so this behaviour has been changed.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  02 Feb 2007 8:09:43 +0100

idnits (2.00.0)

  Quite a bit of changes and some larger feature additions:

  * Changed the error reporting and error return codes.
  * Added download of RFC status file and downref checking based on that.
  * Added --checklistwarn option, to turn ID-Checklist errors into
    warnings (for use with the draft submission tool)
  * Added --status option to set the intended status of a draft, in case
    the draft does not indicate a status (or the correct status) 
  * Added .+.(uri|urn|in-addr).arpa to allowed FQDNs
  * Fixed a bug in reporting embedded copyright notices
  * Tweaked the pemissible format for references to include additional
    acceptable contexts (surroundings) for valid references
  * Cleaned up the output format to be more consistent and less verbose
  * Changed from warnings to errors for failure to use the RFC 4748
    boilerplate
  * Cleaned out some old dead code
  * Added new ID-guidelines checks:

    - The document should say "INTERNET-DRAFT" in the upper right-hand
      corner of the first page
    - The document should have an expiration date on the first (and last) 
      pages.  (not checking last page)
    - The document should have an intended status indication

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Feb 2007 0:07:36 +0100

idnits (1.124)

  * Fixed the regexps used to detect non-RFC3848 IPv6 addresses
  * Changed error exit numbers

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  19 Jan 2007 21:47:00 +0100

idnits (1.123)

  * Added checking for compyright notices embedded in the text, and
    checking if they conform by year and copyright holder to the
    other copyright notices.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  12 Dec 2006 20:49:38 +0100

idnits (1.122)

  * Added support for references of format [REF1, REF2] and similar.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Dec 2006 22:32:21 +0100

idnits (1.121)

  * Added a note about almost matching (but indented) section titles
    for required sections.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  07 Dec 2006 22:32:21 +0100

idnits (1.120)

  * Added warnings for possible use of non-RFC3330 IPv4 addresses
    and non-RFC3848 IPv6 addresses in examples.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Dec 2006 11:34:46 +0100

idnits (1.119)

  * Started to warn about having ISOC copyright instead of IETF Trust
    Copyright

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  01 Dec 2006 11:34:46 +0100

idnits (1.118)

  * Adjusted the error message for 2119 boilerplate reference to non-2119
    document

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  20 Nov 2006 20:54:19 +0100

idnits (1.117)

  * Increased the permitted number of spaces between section number and
    section name from 2 to 3.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  27 Oct 2006 10:49:57 +0200

idnits (1.116)

  * Changed to only permitting top a level section to be identified
    as a References section

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  26 Oct 2006 22:52:59 +0200

idnits (1.115)

  * Tweaked the warning output for some cases of reference look-alikes.
    ASN.1 code for instance may contain [0], [1] etc. which isn't
    references.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  24 Oct 2006 10:32:15 +0200

idnits (1.114)

  * Restricted the FQDN tests to potential FQDNs with all-upper or
    all-lower case.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  14 Oct 2006 11:03:12 +0200

idnits (1.113)

  * An errata has been submitted against 2119 which should have listed
    'NOT RECOMMENDED' as a keyword.  Changed idnits to accept a variation
    of 2119 boilerplate with this present after 'RECOMMENDED'.
    
  * Changed requirements on upload name for the online service; less
    restrictions on the characters in the name.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  13 Oct 2006 8:12:54 +0200

idnits (1.112)

idnits (1.108)

  * Changed the paragraph break at page break determination.  Instead
    of taking a line starting at column zero as a new paragraph
    indication, only an outdent after the page break is taken as a
    new paragraph indication.

  * Now normalizing spacing of document text before cheking against
    boilerplate start patterns.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  29 Aug 2006 11:53:57 +0200

idnits (1.105)

  * Added a listing of the 5 first lines which contain rfc2119 keywords
    when the 2119 keyword nit error is triggered.  To get a comprehensive
    listing of all lines with 2119 keywords, use --verbose --verbose.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  31 Jul 2006 23:38:53 +0200

idnits (1.104)

  * Changed the requirements for 2119 to permit a non-verbatim quote of
    the 2119 language where 'RFC 2119' is replaced by a reference to
    2119.
  * Made the absence of both 2119 boilerplate and 2119 reference an error.

idnits (1.100)

  * Fixed a bug introduced in 1.98 - additional space in 2119 boilerplate.
  * Tuned line-breaking routine, fixing too early line breaking in many
    cases.
  * Changed default output width from 80 to 78.
  * Tweaked regexp used to identify references, so it may contain a space
    (as in for instance \"[RFC 2119]\")
  * Added code to emit missing/unused reference warnings in the order
    references are defined, and for undefined ones, in the order they
    occur in the document.  Earlier, this was random, determined by the
    array index hashing.
  * Reformulated some error messages which used bad english.

idnits (1.98)

  * Now also taking notice of reference usage in appendices.
  * Some bugs when running with nawk fixed (gawk seems to have different
    namespaces for variables and functions, but nawk doesn't, and
    nawk doesn't accept empty alternatives in regexps - e.g., (\|blah)).
    nawk also requires \"]\" to be escaped inside a character class.
  * Refined the identification of References section, as opposed to
    'References' being listed in the table of content.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  23 May 2006 11:33:42 +0200

idnits (1.97)

  * Added a check for the presence of paragrahps almost matching boilerplate
    paragraphs, when the correct boilerplate is also present.  This is meant
    to catch and warn about additional copyright text, usage restrictions or
    other unusal additions to the regular boilerplate.

 * Fixed various nits in the tool, after comments from Bruce Lilly:

 * Adapting to terminal width is now only done up to a maximum width of 76,
   and down to 16

 * Some grammar corrections

 * The column width setting, whether given by the --width switch, by
   setting COLUMNS in the environment, or by running in a narrow terminal
   window, now also applies to boilerplate text

 * The line folding algorithm has been enhanced to not give up as easily

 * All normal output is now folded to match the width setting - previously
   some output lines didn't.  Debug output is not folded.

 * Added additional accepted variations on the names of normative and
   informative sections

 * Added hyphenation warnings again, if it has been possible to extract a
   list of hyphenated words from the draft.  Any fragment of a hyphenated
   word will be accepted on a line-ending, but not hyphenated line-breaks
   which have a line-ending fragment which doesn't occur in a hyphenated
   word somewhere else in the document.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-04-08

idnits (1.66)

 * "Weird spacing" warnings could result from a long title in the header
   line, which is a mistake.  Fixed.  Also tweaked the code to find the awk
   executable in order to provide a default value for the case when 'which'
   is not available on the target system.  Started some work on extracting
   a list of valid words from the document, for use in validation of
   hypenated line-breaks.

idnits (1.63)

 * A warning has been added for drafts which use 3667 boilerplate instead of
   3978 boilerplate (where those differ).  The 3978 boilerplate is now also
   required to be verbatim, with none of the slight variations which was
   accepted earlier (e.g., "he" in stead of "he or she", or "the author"
   instead of "each author").

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2005-04-04

idnits (1.62)

 * RFC 3978 has the copyright notice and the reference to BCP 78 in separate

idnits (1.60)

 * Disabled the hyphenation warnings.  The new xml2rfc (v1.29rc3) does
   line-breaking on hyphens, which is good, but makes it necessary to find a
   more sophisticated algorithm in order not to produce too many spurious
   warnings.

idnits (1.54)

 * Quite a bit of refactoring, and some new features.

 * If output is to a tty, line-wrapping of error
   and warning messages is now done based on the
   width (number of columns) of the controlling
   tty, as reported by `stty size`.

 * Indentation has been changed somewhat, and
   nits are now prefaced with an asterisk (*)
   while warnings are prefaced with a dash (-).

 * Fixed an error where some tests would not be
   run if multiple files were given as input, and
   the first would have an rfc file name.

 * Fixed several problems associated with using
   nawk instead of gawk as awk interpreter.
   Running under stock solaris, without gawk, should
   now work.

 * Added final full stop to a lot of sentences

 * Fixed grammar of messages, so single and plural
   instances of error and warnings get appropriate
   verb and noun conjugations.

 * Added a "--width <number>" switch, mostly in
   order to control regression testing.  It
   overrides the detected terminal width.

 * Some minor message text changes.  Added
   regression tests so that now the Makefile runs
   tests on darwin, linux and solaris for each new
   release.  Cygwin tests will come when I have a
   windows box online.  As a result, some issues
   were discovered for solaris:

 * The default awk is the original awk, so we
   need to search for gawk and nawk.  The
   original awk unfortunately won't do.

 * Even with nawk, there are some issues -
   those have been fixed, so this version should
   run on at least solaris 8 and higher without
   any problems.

idnits (1.38)

 * Added a tiny tweak to the rfc3667_claim
   regexp, to make paragraph merging work for it.
   idnits now correctly validates the output of
   xml2rfc 1.25, which merges this claim with the
   3667 section 5.1 IPR Disclosure Ack.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-09-18

idnits (1.37)

 * Added more diagnostic information for the

   the start of the boilerplate matches: Now

 * Major overhaul of boilerplate matching
   mechanism.  idnits is now attempting to match
   run-together paragraphs containing multiple individual

   run-together boilerplate should be handled with this
   release.

 * Changed the reporting of the filename
   and the invocation of Awk in order to work
   under {Open|Free}BSD

 * Added a check for number of lines to
   the missing ToC test, for drafts which don't
   have page breaks.  Tweaked the Author's address
   detection.

 * Some changes in wording of warnings
   regarding 2026 vs. 3667/3668 boilerplate

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-05-09

idnits (1.26)

 * Not complaining about too long lines when the
   excess is only blank space.
 * Added --verbose switch
 * Reduced complaints about

       - too long lines
       - non-ascii characters
       - hyphenation
       - control characters
       - spacing

   to a single line when not --verbose used

 * Added a warning for claiming conformance with
   2026 but using 3667/8 boilerplate
 * Lines with "........" before intro indicates
   Table of Contents
 * Now permitting "Security Consideration" (no 's')
 * Minor code tweaks

idnits (1.24)

 * The test for numbered reference to RFC 2026
   having been added to the boilerplate was not quite
   right.  Changed, and the diagnostic message
   updated.  Fixed page counting which was broken
   by the v1.23 changes.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-15

idnits (1.23)

 * Added stripping of header/footer lines, in
   order to be able to correctly recognize boilerplate
   which has been split across pages.
 * Improved regexps for boilerplate paragraphs.
 * Added notes when a boilerplate section doesn't
   match, but the start of it matches - could be just a
   boilerplate error then.
 * Did a little code refactoring.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-15

idnits (1.22)

 * Another take on the 3667 vs. 2026 issue.  This
   version observes whether there are 2026 compliant
   sections in the document, and if so notes this and
   verifies against 2026, otherwise it verifies against
   3667. The --no3667 and --rfc3667 switches are no-op's
   in this version.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-08

idnits (1.21)

 * Added tests for the notices required by RFC
   2026.  The handling of 3667 vs. 2026 notices is not
   necessarily perfect - feedback from users would be
   good... :-)  

   Currently, by default idnits looks for 3667
   compliance.  If it doesn't find it, but finds
   equivalent 2026 paragraphs, it notes this when
   pointing out the 3667 non-compliance.  Checking for
   2026 compliance instead of 3667 compliance can be
   done by specifying --no3667.

 * Minor tweaks.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-08

idnits (1.19)

 * Added tests for the notices required by
   RFC 3667 and 3668.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-07

idnits (1.18)

 * Case independent matching of section
   names is now used when the --nowarn flag has
   been specified. This functionality requres the
   awk used to be 'gawk' - other implementations
   of awk will most likely still do case-dependent
   matching.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-07

idnits (1.17)

 * tweaked the regexp for weird spacing a bit,
   to avoid trigging on lists with 'o' bullets.  Changed
   the usage and help output somewhat.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-06

idnits (1.16)

 * idnits is now a SHELL script which starts awk,
   rather than being an awk script directly.  This
   change was done in order to permit giving option
   switches directly, without having to add "--" before
   the switches.
 * added --nowarn option.  With this option,
   only nits according to the ID-nits page ar reported.
   Withouth it, some warnings about misspelling etc. are
   given.
 * Added test for unknown options
 * Also fixed a bug resulting in incorrect line
   numbers when processing multiple files .

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-06

idnits (1.15)

 * Added a slew of new variations on the name of
   the Introduction section, and some other section name
   variations.  All warnings now occurring when run on
   RFC 3600-3742 now seems to be correct and make sense.
   Also zeroed all counters on new filename - required
   for correct operation on multiple files...

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-06

idnits (1.14)

 * Accepting another variant on 'Table of
   Contents' spelling.  Added a warning for misspelling,
   though.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-06

 * Added diagnostic for another misspelling of
   Authors' Address(es)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-04

idnits (1.12)

 * Added another test for table of contents.
   Tweaked some diagnostics' wording.

 * Added printing of program version as first
   output line.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-02

idnits (1.10)

 * Now accepting more variations of the names of
   requried sections.  Added missing newline after
   hyphenation warning.  Refined test for split
   references.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-02

idnits (1.09)

 * Some tests did not work with files
   having DOS line ending - fixed. Added more
   informative diagnostics for non-ascii characters
   and control characters.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-04-01

idnits (1.08)

 * Refined the test for normative /
   informative references somewhat.  Added the
   ability to sensibly handle the case of multiple
   files given on the command line. Added "No nits
   found" output when no nits were found.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-03-30

idnits (1.07)

 * Handling some cases of misspelling.
   Some versions of gawk can't handle \000 in
   patterns, changed that to \001 on line 137.
   Only requireing the first Abstract / Status of
   Memo section to be un-numbered.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-03-18

idnits (1.06)

 * Added test for normative/iformative reference
   section split (code contributed by Pekka Savola)

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  2004-03-16

 * Fixed incorrectly quoted single
   aphostrophes which messed up the test for
   Author's addresses
